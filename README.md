Eilean enables you to host your own digital island where you control your own online infrastructure.
Through the use of open standards and federated protocols Eilean allows you to interoperate with other providers.

[NixOS](https://nixos.org/) is used to enable reproducible deployments of services such as webservers, mailservers, federated communication servers, Virtual Private Network servers, and more.
However, such services still require a lot of manual configuration for domain names, DNS records, user accounts, databases, HTTP proxies, TLS certificates, and more.

Eilean aims to be a optioned framework to allow the simple deployment of these services on a single machine, and a library of documentation for common issues in managing runtime state like secrets, databases, and upgrades.

By using Nix, Eilean modules are extensible to other configurations outside this deployment scenario, such as offloading a particularly resource heavy service to a dedicated machine.

For instructions on getting started see [docs/getting_started.md](./docs/getting_started.md).

Contributions for additional services are welcome.
